# weather-app

Welcome to my Weather-App 🌤️ Application Project,

 - 🌎 Here you can navigate by searching any city's weather, all you have to do is insert a city name in the Search Bar input.
You can also check the detail of a city's weather as well!

 - This was made with ReactJs and the Open Weather API; React is a component based framework, 
   used in Front-End Web Development. For the weather information I used Open Weather API,
   which allows me to send queries and receive responses, the information about the cities
   you see is all thanks to Open Weather! 

Check my About Tab for more information!
